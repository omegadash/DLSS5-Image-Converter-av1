"""Fetch the heavy runtime on first launch instead of shipping it.

PyTorch with CUDA is 2.7 GB unpacked and is essentially the entire size of a
bundled release — the rest of the application is about 300 MB. It is freely
redistributable, so bundling it is *allowed*; it is just wasteful, because every
copy of the app then carries a payload that NVIDIA already require the user to
have a machine capable of running.

So the release ships without it and fetches the wheel once, with a progress bar,
into a folder that survives app updates. This is the same trade the depth model
already makes, and it is what keeps the shareable download small.

Nothing here is a package manager. The wheel is a zip; it is downloaded,
extracted, and put on ``sys.path``. No pip, no network resolution, no version
solving — a pinned URL and an unzip, so the failure modes are "no network" and
"disk full" rather than anything dependency-shaped.
