"""Convert a video, one frame at a time, and carry its audio across.

A video is not treated as a video here. It is a stack of stills: each frame is
decoded, run through exactly the same single-image DLSS path as the photo tab,
and written back in order. DLSS's temporal history is reset every frame, so
nothing from one frame bleeds into the next - which is what keeps the result
stable rather than smeared, because the "motion" between two real frames is not
motion DLSS should try to reproject.

Audio is copied, not touched. The source's audio stream is muxed into the output
unchanged, so a converted clip still has its sound and stays in sync.

PyAV rather than OpenCV for the container work: OpenCV decodes frames but cannot
read or write an audio stream at all, and its encoder list on Windows is
whatever its prebuilt FFmpeg happened to include (no H.264). PyAV bundles a full
FFmpeg, which is where H.264, H.265, NVENC and the AAC muxing all come from. It
is downloaded on first use of this tab, like PyTorch, rather than shipped.
